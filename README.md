# README My Journal App

This is my very first experiment with full stack development, using Node.js on the back end and a NoSQL database. 
It is a fairly simple personal diary app that can be used both on a local server or an online one (I have an online version on Heroku for my personal use).

I want to add other features in the future, e.g.,

	- possibility to edit individual entries,
	
	- search by creation date,
	
	- create and save entries in different categories or add labels to them and group entries by category/label.

Other suggestions are welcome!
